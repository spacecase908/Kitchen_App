# Kitchen_App

My ambitions as a home chef too often exceed my capacity. Between school, work, relationships, fitness, and financial limitations, there is only so much cooking I can do while I am often inundated with recipes and ideas from the myriad content platforms available in the digital age. With high throughput and a long cycle time, my inventory of recipes and potential projects has skyrocketed. Further, many recipes I would like to cook require ingredients the I do not normally stock or use, and leave me with a surplus that I don't know what to do with. 

The goal of this project, aside from getting better at building software, is to help me to explore cuisines and manage my kitchen. A user will be able to store recipes that interest them and track the ingredients in their kitchen. As they decide what to cook, they can see what ingrediants they will need to purchase, and what other recipes could be made with those ingredients. In the opposite direction, a user could see what recipes could be made with their existing ingredients.

I recognize that inventory management for a kitchen poses a few possibly insurmountable user hurdels. Having to record every ingredient purchase, even with some of the nice features I plan to use, will be a pain. Worse still will be tracking ingredient consumption. I do not believe even I would be willing to record every time I use or exhaust an ingredient. I have some ideas about how I might strucure it, but ultimately I don't see this becoming a big product.

That all being said, I think I would use it, or at least parts of it, and there's lots of ways of using this to explore some pretty cool technologies. That is going to be my ultimate guide as I work through this project.
